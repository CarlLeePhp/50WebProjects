                    When a panel is clicked, an active class will be added.
                    A panel has a bigger flex value with the active class. So it will get more space than others.
                    Then 'transition' attribute is used to get the animation.

                <p>
                    The split() method and join() method are used to split the label and reconect it. Another important method is map().
                    It receives a function as the first parameter. The first two parameters of the function are the current value and the index.
                    The map() method will return a new array which consist of the values retured from the function.
